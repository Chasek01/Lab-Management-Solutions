# Lab-Management-Solutions

  This is a lab management software built for stakeholders Bill Nye and Carl Sagan. In the service of downsizing their lab team and streamlining data recording, analysis, and representation, this is an application built to track, log, analyze, and visualize different portions of laboratory and field work in the field of biology. This application will record data, calculate different statistical tests based on the body of data, and visualize the results as needed. The primary users will be principal investigators, and secondary users will likely be those undergraduate and graduate students under their direction. Major capabilities will include saving data and organizing it, determining what statistical tests are best for the data input, run those tests, and visualize those results. The application will determine most of these steps on its own, without the direction of the user.
